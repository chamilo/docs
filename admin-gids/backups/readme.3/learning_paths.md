# Leerpaden

After exporting the learning paths, you might want to know how to import them back into another \(or the same\) Chamilo portal.

In the _My courses_ tab, create an empty course matching the one which has to be imported \(or re-use an existing course\). Once in the course, click _Learning paths_.

In the learning paths tool, you have three options:

* « Create new course » \(1st icon\),
* « Import [SCORM](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharable_Content_Object_Reference_Model) courses » \(2nd icon\),
* « Chamilo Rapid » \(3rd icon\)

To import the learning path previously exported, click on _Import SCORM course_ \(2nd icon\).

The backup must obviously be compatible with SCORM and, something less obvious, SCORM 1.2, which is a particular version of SCORM. Chamilo does not fully support SCORM 2004, so you will probably have a valid learning path import, but it will not remain fully functional, most of the time. Your learning path package can also be AICC compatible, but that's another story.

Note the _Authoring tool_ field is only an informational field and doesn't generate any behaviour modification.
