# Use case - Corporate branding

Imagine your company, KBTS \(fictional name\), offers health and safety courses for several customers. Imagine that one of your customers is Coca-Cola® and the other is Pepsi®.Maybe you don't want these two customers to know you are selling them the same course or that you are using the same portal to teach them. Of course, you would like to be able to re-use the same course \(so as to not duplicate the amount of work\), but without your learners seeing contributions from the learners of the other company... With multi-URL, you can set up cocacola.kbts.com and pepsi.kbts.com to serve that separation purpose.
