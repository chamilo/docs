# Use case - Universitaire faculteiten

Imagine the 12 faculties of your “John Smith University” \(fictional name\) want to show their portal under a distinct appearance \(each one wants its own variation of the logo in the header and a background colour slightly different\).

For example, you would have a general [http://admin.jsu.edu/](http://admin.jsu.edu/), then a specific law faculty: [http://law.jsu.edu/](http://law.jsu.du/), a sciences faculty: [http://sci.jsu.edu/](http://sci.jsu.edu/), etc.

Each one of them has its own teachers, whom, and I quote, “sometimes” have to give a course in more than one faculty. Students are also students from one single faculty \(only a few “exceptional case” are not\). Finally, courses are different, “except” in specific cases for very general courses...
