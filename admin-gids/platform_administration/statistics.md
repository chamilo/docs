Although the statistical data is pretty summarised, it will give you a good idea of the general use of the platform.

Important activities group all the portal administration activities: creation and removal of courses, of users, of sessions; edition of configuration settings and some other... important activities.

Note that you can also check from what IP address an action was taken. This gives you more possibilities in terms of ensuring the legitimate character of an action.
