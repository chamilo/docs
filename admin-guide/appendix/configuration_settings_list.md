Letter casing \(uppercase/lowercase\) doesn't matter. |  |
| Whitelist - setting | The whitelist is used to filter the files extensions by removing \(or renaming\) any file which extension does _NOT_ figure in the whitelist below. It is generally considered as a safer but more restrictive approach to filtering. The extensions should figure without the leading dot \(.\) and separated by semi-column \(;\) like the following: htm;html;txt;doc;xls;ppt;jpg;jpeg;gif;sxw . Files without extension are accepted. Letter casing \(uppercase/lowercase\) doesn't matter. | htm;html;jpg;jpeg;gif;png;swf;avi;mpg;mpeg;mov;flv;doc;docx;xls;xlsx;ppt;pptx;odt;odp;ods;pdf |
| Filtering behaviour \(skip/rename\) | If you choose to skip, the files filtered through the blacklist or whitelist will not be uploaded to the system.

| Permissions for new files | The ability to define the permissions settings to assign to every newly created file lets you improve security against attacks by hackers uploading dangerous content to your portal. The default setting \(0550\) should be enough to give your server a reasonable protection level. The given format uses the UNIX terminology of Owner-Group-Others with Read-Write-Execute permissions.
