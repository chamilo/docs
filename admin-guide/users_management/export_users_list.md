# Export users list

In Chamilo, it is possible to export all or only some of the users.

You can choose between two output save file formats: [XML](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Markup_Language) or [CSV](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values). Most users will use CSV, which can be read by MS-Excel® and OpenOffice.org Calc®.

Once you chose the format, it is recommended to check the “_Yes, add the CSV header”_ option. Then you can pick a limited list of students to export \(by course\) or leave it as is to export all students of the platform. Click on _Export_ to launch the export.

A new window opens to let you decide what to do with the file.
