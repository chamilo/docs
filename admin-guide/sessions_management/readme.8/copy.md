# Copy

Copying promotions or careers is made by using the lists of careers or promotions, by using a double-paper-sheet-shaped icon.

Note: for now, the copy of courses is a **hard copy**, which means you might loose considerable disk space by copying an entire career. Another mode is available \(not yet enabled\) to **soft copy** the courses through the sessions \(use of the same courses through another session, which is just what sessions have been designed for\).
