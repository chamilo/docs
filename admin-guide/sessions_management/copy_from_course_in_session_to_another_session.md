# Copy from course in session to another session

Given the possibility to define content in a course through a session and given the fact that this content will only be visible within this session, you will sometimes need to copy that session-specific content to another session containing the same course... and this is exactly what this tool does.

To use it, you must have an origin and a destination session, in which you can find the same course, from and to which you wish to copy the content of the session.

Once these conditions are met, you'll just have to select the session of origin, the course of origin, the session of destination and the course of destination, then decide whether you want all session-specific contents to be copied or only some of them.

**Note** : this tool is still in beta version. We recommend you use it with caution and you counter-check it does what you expected.
