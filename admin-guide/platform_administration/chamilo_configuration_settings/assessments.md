# Assessments

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/graficos12%20%284%29.png)These are global parameters for the assessments tool, which can be redefined \(in most cases\) tat the course level.

**Marks thresholds colouring** enables the colouring of marks in the assessments. It is also necessary to define the marks that will effectively be coloured red.

**Marks levels labelling** enables setting different levels of marks as labels \(“E” level for less than 50%\).
