# Creating a sub-language

Click on the sub-language creation icon on the extreme-right of the English language line. Fill-in the form by stating a common name for the language \(e.g. “Medical English”\) and an English name without spaces nor accents \(e.g. “medical\_english”\), and an ISO code that is the same as the father language \(in this case “en”\).
