# Assigning the new sub-language

Finally, you have re-defined your terms in your sub-language. The only step remaining is to assign it by default to all new users and all new courses. To do this, go back to the languages list and disable all other languages.

For your sub-language, click on the third icon to make it the default language on the platform. That's it, your platform is now personalised following your domain of activity.

**Note** : This advanced feature answers a double demand from our users and customers :

* allow for the edition, from the web interface, of the interface terms
* allow to re-use these terms without loss, after an update of the platform and without affecting the default language packages
