# Logging in with OpenID

An OpenID feature is available inside Chamilo. It is not as complete as other OpenID implementations around, but if you want to enable it you will have to follow a series of steps:

1. enable the OpenID login in the _Portal settings_ page, _Security_ section
2. make the OpenID field editable by the user from the _Portal settings_, _Users_ section
3. each user will need to indicate and save his own OpenID identifier in his profile.

Work has been started to improve this, but it is likely to only be available in Chamilo 1.10 \(because it requires database changes\).
