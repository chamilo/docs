*Illustration 154: Surveys – Creation form*

Complete the fields, giving your survey a _Code_, a _Title,_ and a _Subtitle_ (description). Optionally, you can set a start and end date so the survey is only available for a limited time. You can choose whether your survey will be anonymous (users&#039; answers will not be identifiable) by checking the relevant box. Finally, write a survey introduction (this is a text that will appear just before the user starts the survey) and a _Final thanks_ message (this will appear when the users finish the survey, to thank them and maybe inform them of when the results will be compiled and used).

In the _Advanced settings_, you can choose whether you want this survey to be considered an essential element of the _Assessments_ (_Gradebook_)_s_tool , whether you want it to be attached to a parent survey (not documented in this guide yet), whether you want to have one question per page or whether you want to shuffle questions.

Remember to click the _Create survey_ button.
