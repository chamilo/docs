## Interaction tools {#interaction-tools}

The objective of the interaction section is to group tools which facilitate communication between learners as well as between learner and teacher. Unlike the _Authoring_ tools which are primarily for teacher use, The _Interaction_ tools are provided mainly for use by other users also, to support their learning.

### Notebook {#notebook}

The notebook tool provides a simple means for users to write and store and organize such notes within the platform for their own use, using the on-line editor. Notes created by this tool are private: no user has access to the notes of another user.

### Video-conference {#video-conference}

![](../assets/graphics106.png)It is now relatively easy, using a local video-conference server, to install the video-conference tool within a Chamilo course, although it remains an external extension which is not always available in a classic portal. Chamilo 1.9 supports BigBlueButton 0.8, open-source conferencing software which supports recording of the white board and audio from a conference. The video sessions can later be made available within Chamilo itself as a video library inside the course. From a teacher&#039;s point of view, it&#039;s worth lobbying your administrator to set it up!
