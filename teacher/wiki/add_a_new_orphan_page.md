## Add a new orphan page {#add-a-new-orphan-page}

By clicking the _Add new page_ link inside the drop-down menu icon ![](../assets/graphics210.png) , you create a new page, unrelated to the rest of the wiki. This is one way of preparing a page which will temporarily not be visible to users (at least not in the usual way).

**Note** : Orphan pages can be listed from the _All pages_ link in the drop-down menu.
