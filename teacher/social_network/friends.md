## “Friends” {#friends}

In the _Social network_ tab, you can make contacts and invite them as _Friends_ (a rather free use of the term _friend_!). You can search for people by:

*   clicking the _Invitations_ link in the left menu ![](../assets/graphics340.png),

*   click _Search_.

By simply entering a few characters of the user&#039;s first or last name, Chamilo will help by proposing a list of users matching these characters. The invitation can then be sent to the user, who can choose whether to accept or refuse it.

The _Friends_ link ![](../assets/graphics342.png) gathers all friends you have linked to on the platform. It allows you to see the shared profile of the user and send him a message with a click on his name.
