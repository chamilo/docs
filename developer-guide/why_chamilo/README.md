# Why Chamilo?

![](../../.gitbook/assets/images21%20%288%29.png)

Chamilo is an e-learning and collaboration platform which comes bundled as open-source software \(or as purists will rightfully correct, _Free Software_\) which can be adapted to educational or professional projects. It is distributed under the [GNU/GPLv3+](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licence_publique_générale_GNU) license, which you are bound to accept when using it.

Chamilo \(as a software\) has two key aims:

1. to support the teacher in better responding to the needs of their students and
2. to make it so easy to build and edit high-quality digital learning materials that the teacher can not only create but be inspired to develop and continuously improve their courses' content.

The goal of the Chamilo Association, through the publishing of Chamilo, is to "Increase the availability of quality education worldwide".

A teacher using Chamilo can access a series of useful tools allowing them to easily and efficiently create an effective learning environment. On creating/editing a course he \(or she\) can:

* import or create **documents** \(audio, video, images\) and publish them,
* build **tests** and **exams** with **automated scores and feedback** as required,
* build or import \([SCORM](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharable_Content_Object_Reference_Model) and [AICC](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Industry_CBT_Committee)\) compliant courses,
* set and receive **virtual assignments**,
* describe the components of the course through **description** sections,
* communicate through **forums** or **chat**,
* publish **announcements**,
* add **links**,
* create **work groups** or laboratory groups,
* set up a **virtual classroom** \(through the videoconference extension\),
* manage **scores** through the assessments tool,
* create **surveys**,
* add a **wiki** to create documents collaboratively,
* use a **glossary**,
* use an **agenda**,
* manage a **project** \(through the **blog** tool\),
* enable **tracking** of learners in your courses,
* register **attendances**,
* elaborate **a class diary \(course progress\)**.

The Chamilo platform is extremely **flexible**. All its tools can be customized according to the needs of each course. It provides a **friendly** and **intuitive** user interface which requires no special prior technical knowledge or skills.
