# Certificaten genereren

You can readily create a certificate for students successfully completing the course. To do so, just make the last step in your course a certificate which students can view or print off. You can upload an existing pre-made certificate to the course documents area \(e.g. an image or .pdf file\). Alternatively, Chamilo offers a tool for creating certificate templates, which allows for the automatic generation of a certificate detailing relevant data for each learner in the course \(see Chapter 18\).
