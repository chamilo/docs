Give a name to your learning path and click _Continue_. The learning path is created immediately \(without content for the time being\). It will appear in the learning paths list. Once the learning path is created, you get access to a series of tools to:

* update the learning path's settings ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics8%20%284%29.png)
* add and order elements as you build the learning path ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics22%20%281%29.png)
* add an activity / object / document ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics23%20%284%29.png)
* add a new section ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics19%20%284%29.png)
* use a preview screen to check how it's going to look for learners![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics21%20%284%29.png)

: Note that Chamilo uses the simple term “course” here rather than “learning path”. Don't confuse this with the the term “course” as applied to the overall course \(Learn English in the illustration\)
