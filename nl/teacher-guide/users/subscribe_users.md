Let's look first at how to subscribe new users as learners to the course. On the main _Users_ pagetoolbar, click on the _Enroll users to course_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics172%20%283%29.png)_._ This will display a list of users registered on the platform not subscribed to the course:

Illustration 100: Users â€“ Action buttons

To subscribe a single learner, just click the _Register_ link ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics174%20%283%29.png) to the right of their listing.

To subscribe several learners at once, check the relevant boxes on the left hand side, then select the _Register_ option in the drop-down list headed _Detail_ at the bottom of the table \_\(\_a confirmation window appears to ensure you want to subscribe them: once confirmed, a confirmation list appears indicating which learners have been subscribed.\)

## Add teachers <a id="add-teachers"></a>

You can also subscribe another user as teacher in your course. Just click the second _Enroll teacher_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics175%20%283%29.png) \(he's wearing a tie!\) and repeat the process as for learners. Users subscribed using this link will have the status of _Teacher_ on the course.

## Unsubscribe a user <a id="unsubscribe-a-user"></a>

You can unsubscribe users individually or as a group from a course.

To unsubscribe a single user, click the _Unregister_ button ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics177%20%283%29.png) next to the corresponding user and confirm your choice.

To unsubscribe a group of users, check the relevant boxes on the left side of the table and select _Unregister_ in the drop-down list headed _Detail_ at the bottom of the table, then click _U**nregister**._

**Note** : As a teacher you cannot remove the main teacher of a course \(by default described in the listing as Trainer\) from this screen. Only the platform administrator can do that.

## Add/update a user's description <a id="add-update-a-user-s-description"></a>

* Click the _Edit_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics176%20%281%29.png) to the right of the relevant user's entry to view the user's basic details;
* Complete/update the _Description_ field to inform other users of the role played by this user;
* Save changes.

The _Assistant_ box \(previously titled _Tutor_\) allows the teacher to assign a special _Course assistant_ role with its corresponding permissions. These permissions allow the assistant to view test and assignments results from other learners in the course, to help him assist the teacher in this role.

## Search for a subscribed learner <a id="search-for-a-subscribed-learner"></a>

If the teacher needs to find a specific learner in the list of users subscribed to the course, the search feature will allow him to find one or several users from all or part of his first name or last name.

Just fill in the search field with the relevant characters and click the _Search_ button. A list of matching users will be displayed.

## Export the list of subscribed users <a id="export-the-list-of-subscribed-users"></a>

You might want, \(independently of the backup copies taken by your careful administrator!\) to keep a separate copy of your users list. To do so, from the main _Users_ page, click one of the export icons in the toolbar \(_CSV export_ ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics178%20%283%29.png) _Excel export_ ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics179%20%283%29.png) _or .pdf export_ ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics363%20%283%29.png)\) to download the list of users in the corresponding format.

**Note**: not all users details are exported through this feature \(their passwords, for example, are confidential information not available to other users, not even to the teacher\).

## Display learners reporting <a id="display-learners-reporting"></a>

The teacher can directly access details from the main _Users_ page about each learner's participation in the course by clicking on the _Reporting_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics180%20%283%29.png) next to the user's listing. This will link to the L_earners details in course_ page, described more fully in chapter 15 above.
