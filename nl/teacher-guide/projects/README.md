# Projecten

The _Projects_ or _Blogs_ tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics307%20%283%29.png) was developed in 2006 at the request of a large Belgian telecoms company. The idea behind it was to implement a blog with lightweight project management features, which was tagged under the name of _Smart blogs_. Its philosophy is to allow for the assignment of tasks to the learners in order to write the contents of a story-telling type blog.

The teacher takes responsibility for choosing learners who will contribute to the blog, and defines the project and the assignment of tasks \(or roles taken by the learners\). The creation of articles is shared between the teacher and the learners.

The tool can, however, be used as a classic blog.

**Note** : When a new project is created, it appears in the list of course Authoring tools on the course homepage. Its visibility can be controlled like that of other tools. One main difference by comparison to other tools is that one can create several blogs in the same course. They will appear as multiple entries in the Authoring tools in much the same way as with links and learning paths.
