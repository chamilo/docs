# Cursussen organiseren

With Chamilo, one can end up managing a large quantity of courses. In addition to _general_ course categories, all course creators have an option to create _personal_ categories, visible only to the user who created them, to help him organize his courses.

**Note** : This feature is not supported by the platform's developers anymore, and might be abandoned in the future. It can result in a conflict with the courses order on the My courses _page when these are registered within sessions._
