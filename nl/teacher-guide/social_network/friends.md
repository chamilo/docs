# "Vrienden"

In the _Social network_ tab, you can make contacts and invite them as _Friends_ \(a rather free use of the term _friend_!\). You can search for people by:

* clicking the _Invitations_ link in the left menu ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics340%20%281%29.png),
* click _Search_.

By simply entering a few characters of the user's first or last name, Chamilo will help by proposing a list of users matching these characters. The invitation can then be sent to the user, who can choose whether to accept or refuse it.

The _Friends_ link ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics342%20%281%29.png) gathers all friends you have linked to on the platform. It allows you to see the shared profile of the user and send him a message with a click on his name.
