# Sociale groepen

The _Social groups_ link ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics341%20%281%29.png) compiles together all groups that exist on the platform. These groups can only be created by administrators, unless they have enabled this option for all users.

There are two types of groups, depending on access:

* public \(everybody can join\)
* private \(the group administrator must authorize the membership request\)

The _My groups tab_ lists the groups of which you are a member. These groups work as a forum. The administrator \(or moderator\) creates discussion topics and users start contributing.
