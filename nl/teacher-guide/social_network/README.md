# Sociaal netwerk

Chamilo recognizes that effective online social interaction is an important element in successful online learning. The Social Network facility offered on the platform is designed to optimize support, within the platform, for teachers and learners wanting to make use of various social network features as an integral part of their online learning \(and teaching\) experience. These include simple profiling, an internal messaging system available to users and the facility to create interest groups. \(Note that some of these features need to be enabled by the platform administrator.\)
