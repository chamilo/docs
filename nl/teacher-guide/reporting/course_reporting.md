# Cursusrapportage

Clicking on the _course report_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics187.png) on the Reporting page provides global information about the

course as a whole that the teacher can use in evaluating or developing the course. This includes information such as general progress through learning paths, overall test scores, participation in forum and chats, tools used, documents downloaded and links visited. As with other reporting pages, information can be readily exported as csv files or printed by clicking the relevant tool bar icons.
