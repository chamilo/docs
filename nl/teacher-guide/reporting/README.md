# Rapportage

Chamilo allows teachers to follow the progress of their learners using various tools, primarily via the _Reporting_ tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics44.png) \(accessed via the _Administration tools_ section at the bottom of the course homepage\) but also through the assignment of homework and tests/exercises during the course. The reporting tool allows teachers to monitor the activities and progress of individual learners, the overall progress of classes through courses, and the development of content and resources.
