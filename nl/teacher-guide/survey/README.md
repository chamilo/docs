The S_urvey_ tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics290.png) allows the teacher to collect information, views and opinions from course participants. It might typically be used during or at the end of a course as an aid to overall course evaluation, or it may be used at the beginning of a course to gather information about learners' interests, aspirations, previous achievements etc. in order to help the teacher tailor aspects of the course content to suit his learners.
