# Bestaande vragen recyclen

Any question created, independently of the test or course to which it has been attached, feeds the questions database. This base can be very useful for teachers wanting to re-use questions that are very general or, needing questions to serve as “fillers” when you're short of a few questions in a new test.

During test creation, the database shows questions from other tests, as well as orphan questions \(i.e. those questions which have belonged to a test which has been removed\).

When the question database shows, it presents a list of all existing questions inside the course. This is where assigning questions to categories and adding a difficulty to tests can prove very useful for identifying individual questions: use the _Filter_ and _Difficulty_ drop-down lists to filter the questions accordingly.

To access the database, click on the _recycle existing questions_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics361%20%281%29.png) as it is listed on the _Create a question_ page alongside the various question types:

Click the _Re-use in current test_ button ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics155%20%281%29.gif) to include these questions in the current test. What actually happens \(in Chamilo 1.9\) is that a copy of the old test is included in the current test, so that it can be edited if necessary for the new test without its content or configuration being altered within the test in which it was originally created.
