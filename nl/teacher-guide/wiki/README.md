# Wiki

The _Wiki_ tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics208.png) is a collective or collaborative redaction tool. It allows users to work together on a single document, and to follow the history of modifications. It also allows you to save time and be more efficient during a group task. In many ways, it complements the forum tool.

A wiki page can contain many links to other pages, which may or may not \(yet\) have existing content. Wiki pages can be updated; each contributor sharing the same rights to write and edit content. Originally designed to support collaboration between learners, the wiki may, at the beginning of a course, consist only of a list of links inserted by the teacher, pointing to empty pages which each learner will have to build using one another's ideas, views and experiences.
