# Andere wiki-functies

The menu located in the top left corner \(drop-down menu\) gives access to other wiki features, regardless of the current page:

* search titles or contents of pages,
* display a list of all the pages,
* list only the latest modifications,
* remove the whole wiki \(be careful with this command!\),
* see the most active users,
* see the most visited pages,
* see the most updated pages,
* see all orphan pages,
* see all empty pages \(wanted pages\) created as such in order to invite somebody else to add content on a given topic.
