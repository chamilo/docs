# Sessieweergave

From Chamilo 1.8.8 platforms onwards, if your platform uses _Course sessions_ a new view type has become available from the _My courses_ tab. This is a special “sessions” view, which you will find is a very different way of presenting courses and tools \(specifically learning paths and tests\).

One main difference from previous versions of Chamilo is that the session title is now a link which leads directly to a page whose appearance differs in many ways from the rest of Chamilo. \(This is a new format of presentation that we will be studying over the next few months, and we're counting on your help and feedback. Do let us know what you think on the Chamilo forum: [http://www.chamilo.org/](http://www.chamilo.org/)\)

This new concept relies essentially on a new way of setting up tests and learning paths based on timescales. By making sure each exercise and learning path has a start and end date, the data shown in these screens make far more sense. \(As such, it is not well suited to asynchronous teaching i.e. purely remote e-learning, with its relatively free timescales.\)
