# Tabblad Cursussen

The _Courses_ tab shows a list of courses available inside the sessions. Click on one of these courses \(the text will turn black\) to filter the rest of the tabs to show only items from this course.

Clicking directly on one of the tabs will show a complete list of all corresponding resources in the session \(if you don't click on one specific course in the first tab, the _Learning paths_ tab will show all learning paths in the session, all courses mixed up\).
