# Mijn MCQ-tabblad

The _My MCQ_ tab contains all tests pertaining to courses in the session, sorted by publication date. Because the display of these test is relative \(comparing results to those of other learners\) and is in a chronological order, it is doubly critical to establish publication dates for all your tests.

Exercises which have not yet been attempted are indicated by a yellow star ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics371%20%283%29.png). The number of attempts is indicated as well as the exercise results, and also the highest scores obtained by any learner in the session. Finally, the position in the table reflects a learner's relative results within this session. By clicking the test title, the learner goes directly to the test or, once all attempts have been exhausted, directly to the test results screen.
