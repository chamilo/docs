# Reply to a specific message

The _Reply to this message_ icon (![](../../.gitbook/assets/images89%20%281%29.png)), located below the message author's picture allows you to give an answer which will be linked to the chosen message and will be hierarchically dependent on that message.

The reply procedure is the same as the previous one, except the message topic includes the initial message, prefixing it with a « Re : » indicating the two messages are related.
