# Using forum views

Depending on the complexity of exchanges on the forums, several display modes can be used to simplify reading and answering discussion threads.

* **List view** : simply shows messages in chronological order,
* **threaded view** : shows only one answer thread at a time,
* **nested view** : uses the threaded view but displays a complete subject.
