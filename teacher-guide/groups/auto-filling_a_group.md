# Auto-filling a group

To quickly add course members to a group, click the _Add users_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics283.png) on the right of the group listing on the main _Groups_ page. Use the batch processing \(drop-down list at the bottom\) to automatically fill several groups. You can't set parameters for filling groups \(e.g. alphabetical, random etc\), but you can always edit the group membership manually afterwards. You can clear all members from a group by clicking the _Unsubscribe all users_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics284.png) in the listing. If you have a long list of groups to manage, use the check boxes on the left and the batch processing option \(i.e. the drop-down list at the bottom\) to automatically fill several groups:
