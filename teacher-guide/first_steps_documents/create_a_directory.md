# Create a directory

To achieve a clearer storage structure, Chamilo lets you create directories \(folders\) and sub-directories by clicking on the folder icon with the yellow star symbol ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics114.png) .

To create a directory:

* click on the _Create folder_ icon,
* enter the directory name,
* click on the _Create the folder_ button,
* The new directory has been created and can be used right away to store new documents.

  If you want to create a sub-directory, open the directory you want to create it in and follow the same procedure.
