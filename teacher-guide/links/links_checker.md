# Links checker

Since version 1.8.8.4, you can \(manually\) check whether a link is alive. To do this, click the small magnifier icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics223.png) on the right side of the link as it is listed in the Links page. After a few seconds \(or less\), an icon appears. A green tick ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics224.png) means the link is valid. A red sign ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics225.gif) means the link is broken.

> **Note**: the links checker effectively tries to connect to the given link **from the server.** As such, a link that works for you might not work for the server, and vice-versa. This will require the server to be equipped with the CURL library. Check with your admin if this is the case.
