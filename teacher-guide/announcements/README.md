# Announcements

The _Announcements_ tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics226%20%283%29.png) lets you send a message 
by e-mail to your learners and/or publish a message directly to the course.

These announcements can be used, for example, to inform learners of the recent availability of a document, 
of the deadline for an assignment or any news or information related to the course.
