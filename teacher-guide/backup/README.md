# Backup

Chamilo makes a distinction between maintenance tools and course settings to simplify course maintenance and backup. Deleting, emptying, copying, saving or recovering the contents of a course \(partly or completely\) can be executed quickly and efficiently using the _Backup_ tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics329.gif):

> **Note** : Features for saving, copying, recovering etc. have been developed with the intention of managing **content**. For this reason, interactions with or between users are not saved. To save them, you'll have to ask your platform administrator to do a full backup of the portal. If you are the administrator, this procedure is described in the admin guide.
