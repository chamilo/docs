# Visibility and access

The _Course access_ section ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics323%20%283%29.png) allows you to define how open access to your course will be by selecting the _Course visibility_ settings \(already described in Control course access on page 20\). These settings \(_public, open, private_ or _closed_\) are fully defined on the page. On this page you can also:

* obtain a _direct link_ to send e.g. via email or a web page to invite registration to this course
* allow self-subscription and unsubscription
* provide a registration password to allow access by unsubscribed users
* establish legal terms to be displayed on entry to the course
