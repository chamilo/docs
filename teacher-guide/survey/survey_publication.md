# Survey publication

If you are satisfied with the survey, you just need to publish it \(make sure you don't contradict yourself with the start date, sending the invitation by e-mail for a survey which is not yet available!\)

Click the _Publish_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics293.png). Select the course users to send the survey invitation to:

In addition/alternatively, send invitations using the same form directly by e-mail \(separate email addresses using semi-colons\). Invitations can be sent to people who are not registered users on the platform \(e.g. you may wish to send the invitation to potential customers, or to parents of learners\):

Once you have completed the fields, remember to click the _Publish survey_ button.

> **Note**: you can also invite anonymous individuals without requiring an email address \(e.g. visitors to a web page\) using the Generate access link icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics294.png) in the survey listings.
