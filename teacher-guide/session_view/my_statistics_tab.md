# My statistics tab

The _My statistics_ tab offers teachers and learners an innovative set of features, provided publication dates have been established for exercises. Learners will then be able to see a visual result of their scores in comparison with those of other learners.

This detailed view presents a graphical visualization of the scores repartition. Each bar represents a rank of results \(0-20%, 21-40%, 41-60%, 61-80%, 81-100%\). The global chart represents the repartition of all students' results for this exercise. The orange bar is the bar in which the current user's results are located. You can click the chart to get an exploded view.
