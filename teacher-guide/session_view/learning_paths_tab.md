# Learning paths tab

The _Learning paths_ tab shows a list of learning paths in the session, filtered according to course \(as long as you clicked a course in the first tab\).

_Illustration: Sessions – Learning paths_

The publication date of each learning path gives you an idea of the chronological order of the learning paths. Where you have several simultaneous courses \(which might be the case in a session\) all offering several learning paths, organizing the right learning paths schedule will provide the learner with a clear indication of the order in which we expect him to follow them. The learner can enter a learning path directly from this screen, simply by clicking its name.

> **Note** : there are three view types for learning paths: _All, Per week, By course._ They do not affect the way contents are ordered, so don't hesitate to try them out.
