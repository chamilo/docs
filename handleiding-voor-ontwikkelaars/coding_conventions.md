# Coderingsconventies

Coding conventions available here :

[https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/wiki/Coding-conventions](https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/wiki/Coding-conventions)

We have recently decided to go in the direction of [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/), including [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-0](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/) so, if in doubt, follow PSR, with some exceptions to respect Chamilo conventions first.
