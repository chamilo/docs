# Voor wie is deze gids bedoeld?

This guide has been written with developers and e-learning implementors in mind: the many technical professionals involved in installing, fine-tuning or customizing a Chamilo LMS portal should find this manual a useful resource for any modification they want to undertake and that is not feasable through the web interface of Chamilo LMS.

In short, the people to which we are directing this manual are :
