Chamilo User Guides
===================

This is the complete set of Chamilo Guides for users of Chamilo.

* [Administrator guide](admin/README.md)
* [Teacher guide](teacher/introduction/what_is_chamilo.md)
* [Developer guide](developer/introduction/what_is_chamilo.md)

Most users will not require to read all guides, and will have plenty of information (maybe too much) just going through the teacher guide. However, if you want to know more or your role in your organization is specifically that of a Chamilo administrator or a developer or sysadmin, you might be interested by the Admin Guide and the Developer Guide that follow.

If you are looking at this documentation on the web, and if you find any issue, please consider creating an account on https://gitbook.com and submitting change requests directly. This website allows it, so why not becoming a documentation contributor and help Chamilo become more accessible to others?

To proceed, just click any section in the table of contents or search for a specific topic from the search bar.
