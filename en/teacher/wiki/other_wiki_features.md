## Other wiki features {#other-wiki-features}

The menu located in the top left corner (drop-down menu) gives access to other wiki features, regardless of the current page:

*   search titles or contents of pages,

*   display a list of all the pages,

*   list only the latest modifications,

*   remove the whole wiki (be careful with this command!),

*   see the most active users,

*   see the most visited pages,

*   see the most updated pages,

*   see all orphan pages,

*   see all empty pages (wanted pages) created as such in order to invite somebody else to add content on a given topic.
