## Create a backup {#create-a-backup}

For security and procedural reasons, it is recommended that you create a backup copy of the complete contents of your course. This procedure is automated. It allows you to create either a complete backup or a partial backup, based on your selection of what to save, using a few simple clicks. To begin backup:

*   click on the _Create backup_ link in the _Backup and import_ section_![](../assets/graphics330.gif)_,

*   on the next page, select whether you want a full copy or just a selection of elements (in which case you will have to select them on the next page and click _Validate_),

*   click the _Create backup_ button to launch the procedure.

The backup is made available in the form of a compressed file which you can download on your computer. It is also stored on the server for quick restoration if needed.
