## Learning paradigm {#learning-paradigm}

Some learning management systems fall into the trap of attempting to support a specific learning/teaching methodology (e.g. social constructivism), perhaps in order to win some short-lived pedagogical credibility. While focusing on a single paradigm is appropriate, even desirable, on the part of individual teachers or organizations, we believe it is not up to the platform developers to fall to the temptation to limit the design of the platform to one specific approach.

In our experience, the role of a Learning Management System is to provide a tool that can adapt to the needs and wishes of the user. Providing “the right tool for the job” may be fine for single-purpose tools (a hammer, a fork or a pencil). For a complex tool such as a LMS, however, it is a combination of the platform&#039;s wide range of flexible and adaptable features and the teacher&#039;s creative use of those features that will, in time, result in courses which reflect an appropriate specific learning methodology, be it social constructivism, instructionalism, behaviorism, radical constructivism, symbolic interactionism, etc. Chamilo acknowledges the role of the teacher in choosing their own teaching approach, and strives to ensure that all of these educational paradigms can all be effectively implemented using various combinations of the flexible tools provided on its platform.

Chamilo LMS enables anyone to develop a course using whatever paradigm/approach/method you as a teacher (or your institution/company) feel comfortable with and, as such, makes sure you have the right tools for the job.
