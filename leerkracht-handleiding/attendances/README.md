# Toeschouwers

In 2010, an academical institution co-financed the development of the A_ttendances_ tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics240%20%283%29.png) as well as the _course progress_ tool \(see next chapter\) with a set of basic specifications. Over time it has evolved, thanks to the many suggestions from community users and the financial support of some customers. Today it's a more advanced tool, but it is still very young, which explains why its interface still leaves room for improvement.

Before you go further with this chapter, do make sure you have learners subscribed to your course, otherwise your attempts to use it will not work. If need be, review the Users chapter on page 95. Without learners subscribed, it is practically impossible to make sense of the attendances tool.
