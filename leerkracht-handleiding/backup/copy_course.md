# Cursus kopiëren

The _Copy course_ feature ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics332%20%283%29.gif) allows you to copy all or part of a course to another \(empty\) course. To use it, you first need to have another course available to copy it to.

From the Backup page:

* click _Copy course_,
* select the destination course
* select the elements to copy \(all or part of the origin course\)
* select what to do when the files in the destination course already exist \(rename or overwrite\),
* click the _Copy course_ button.

**Note** : A message will confirm if the course was successfully copied
