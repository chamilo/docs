# Update de algemene cursusinstellingen

By default, this page \(a series of vertical tabs\) displays the main _Course settings_ where you can:

* enter or edit the course title,
* enter/edit the general category to which the course belongs,
* choose the language in which the course interface is set \(this can be set to language other than that of the platform, - particularly useful for a “total immersion” language course\).
* enter a Department name and/or web address
* add a picture to be displayed in the course catalogue \(important for “marketing” your course\)
* choose a stylesheet for this course from a drop down menu \(by default that of the platform\)

**Note** : the **D\*\***_epartment_\*\* is a feature for which support has been dropped so far. Depending on visual styles, the department might appear as a link in the campus header \(for old, deprecated styles\). This is all a department will change. In more recent version of Chamilo 1.8, if you need to manage courses by departments inside a university, we recommend you use the multi-url feature, described in the administrator's guide, little brother of this guide_._
