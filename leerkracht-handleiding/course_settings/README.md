# Cursusinstellingen

The _Settings_ tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics320%20%283%29.png) in the _Administration_ section of the course homepage allows you to edit the overall behaviour of the course \(most options will affect several tools\). Although it is placed in a remote location at the bottom of the page \(and at the end of this manual\), it is generally a good idea to use it at the beginning of your course to manage subscription settings and course access \(see later: Visibility and access Visibility and access section\).

**Note**: Course tutors using the course inside the session will not have access to this tool as configuration changes might affect other sessions.
