# Gebruikersrechten

The _User rights_ section ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics325%20%283%29.png) allows you to set particular permissions for users in this course, including the right to add events to the _Agenda,_ to add _Announcements._ It also allows you to hide personal user pictures in the _Forums_, as well as decide whether users have access to the _Users_ list.

\(**Note**: This is independent of the visibility of the tool in the course homepage and is a real access change \(the visibility of tools is only a homepage setting and does not prevent users entering the tool if they know the URL\).
