# Zoek een forumelement

All the screens of the _Forum_ tool include a search feature. The search can be executed in all the forums at once and you can combine search terms with the “+” sign. The results are sent in the form of a list indicating:

* the forum category,
* the forum title,
* the title of the thread in which the searched words have been found.
