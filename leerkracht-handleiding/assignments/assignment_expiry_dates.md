# Vervaldatums van de opdracht

Chamilo offers two time-based options for the assignments:

* a “handing over” deadline: the date past which all assignments sent by the learners to the platform are marked as expired in red in the list of assignments. Past this date, assignments can still be sent, but they are marked to indicate late delivery.
* a “final acceptance” date: this is the date past which it becomes impossible for the learners to send an assignment . It is the definitive date after which the teacher will not consider any more work sent.

To configure these, check the relevant boxes in the _advanced settings_ of the _Create assignment_ page.
