# Een evenement toevoegen aan de persoonlijke agenda

The Personal Agenda, available at any point while navigating Chamilo via the relevant tab, works in exactly the same way as the course Agenda, except that options to create events are limited to the “direct” method \(i.e. clicking/dragging on the relevant date/times to open a simple pop-up dialogue window \(see above\). Deleting, editing and exporting options for “personal” events can also be effected \(as with the course _Agenda\)_ simply by clicking on an event to display a pop-up dialogue box. Teachers and learners need to bear in mind that the \(blue\) personal events cannot be viewed by anyone other than themselves.
